# Medium Readme Style

For Medium-level DSA problems, each question is organized in its own separate folder.
Unlike Easy or Basic problems, where notes were maintained in a single README, Medium problems follow a more structured and detailed approach.

Each problem folder contains:
- One or more Java files (different approaches if applicable)
- A dedicated README.md explaining the problem and solution in detail

For Easy problems, the README files were initially generated with the help of ChatGPT.
From now on, all README files will be written by me, with ChatGPT used only for final review before pushing the code.

Below is the standard format followed for every Medium-level problem README.

## Example

## Problem Statement
A short and clear description of the problem (from GFG / LeetCode).

### Input / Output
**Input:**  
Description of input  

**Output:**  
Expected output  

### Approach
- Explanation of the core idea used to solve the problem  
- Why this approach works  

### Dry Run
Step-by-step execution using a sample input (2–3 steps).

### Time & Space Complexity
**Time Complexity:** O(?)  
**Space Complexity:** O(?)  

### Key Learning
- Applying binary search on the answer space instead of a sorted array  
- Handling edge cases and boundary conditions
