# Day 19 Of Visira Journey

Solved **DSA problem**:
check **divisibility by 13** for a very large number.

Also:
- gave **practical exam**
- submitted **assignment and practical file**

In the evening:
- practiced **bowling** for **Avahan 2025** (college fest)

Travelled back home
because **kal Sunday hai hehehe**.

Productive but hectic day.

TADA!!!
