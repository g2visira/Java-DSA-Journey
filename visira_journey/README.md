# Visira Journey

This is not a tutorial repo.
This is my raw learning journal.

Here I document:
- What I study
- What I understand
- What confuses me
- How my thinking evolves
- Last but not the least Dil ki baatien jo is journal ke madhyam se aapke sath mai share karunga!!

No fake productivity.
No tutorial copy-paste.
Only real grind.

## Note to Future Me
If you're reading this and feeling lost again —
trust the process, idiot. You’ve been here before.

Or han yaad rakhna...
Ye jo tuta hai tu tara banke, ubhrega ek din sitara banke!!
